# FEWD-May-17-Blog-Website

My project is to design a blog that will compile some basic information about movies and television shows that make reference to greek life. This blog would serve as a useful data source to compare and contrast the data compiled. This is a project I chose to persue because I would life to continue working on it in the future building out more features with backend development. 

To run my project you will need to download the zip files or clone my project to open index.html in a browser of your choice. No additional software will be needed to run this project.
